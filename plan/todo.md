Last on Dec 5 to do:
- Ensure site is more responsive and mobile friendly
- Fix issue where can't expand/collapse nodes by clicking - (we always scroll down to content)
- Possibly add a list hierarchial view instead of a tree diagram
- we have to better handle repocontents (we have horizontal spacing issues)
